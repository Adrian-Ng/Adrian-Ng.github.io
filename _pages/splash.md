Along the way, you'll also visit some places I photographed long ago. Like myself, this website is very much a work in progress."

java:
  - excerpt: "After cutting my teeth on _Java_ during my _MSc_ dissertation project, I found it stimulating and a joy to work with. Since then I have been fortifying my Java. My code makes use of, for instance, _interfaces & abstract_ classes, _Java 8 Streams_, and multithreading in the form of _callable futures_."

Long gone are the days where one could simply hook into the API and download a fat, juicy csv-file of historical stock price data... or a sensible JSON of option prices.

Thankfully there are many alternatives out there, such as the __Yahoo Finance API__'

datascience:
  - excerpt: "In 2017, I graduated from Royal Holloway with an MSc in Data Science. I have no aspirations to be a _Data Scientist_. However, I did enjoy the experience of writing my own implementations of algorithms such as _K Nearest Neighbours_, _Neural Networks_, and _Hierarchical Clustering_ in __R__. Also used was __MATLAB__, which no-one uses so projects worked on in this language will be added last."
