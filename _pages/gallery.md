excerpt: "This is the website of __Adrian Ng__. _My_ website. Here you will see examples of my _Java projects_ and my notes on writing _SQL_. 

Along the way, you'll also visit some places I photographed long ago. Like myself, this website is very much a work in progress."

java:
  - excerpt: "After cutting my teeth on _Java_ during my _MSc_ dissertation project, I found it stimulating and a joy to work with. Since then I have been fortifying my Java. My code makes use of, for instance, _interfaces & abstract_ classes, _Java 8 Streams_, and multithreading in the form of _callable futures_."

sql:
  - excerpt: "In a past life, my expertise lay in working with SQL databases and writing queries and stored procedures. [Here are some of my notes](http://adrian.ng/SQL/ddl/intro/)"  

datascience:
  - excerpt: "In 2017, I graduated from Royal Holloway with an MSc in Data Science. I have no aspirations to be a _Data Scientist_. However, I did enjoy the experience of writing my own implementations of algorithms such as _K Nearest Neighbours_, _Neural Networks_, and _Hierarchical Clustering_ in __R__. Also used was __MATLAB__, which no-one uses so projects worked on in this language will be added last."
