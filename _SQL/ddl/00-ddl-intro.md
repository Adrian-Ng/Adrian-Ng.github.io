Structured Query Language (SQL) is an easy-to-learn, albeit, high level language that you'll find being used pretty much wherever you come across relational databases.
It is used in essentially two ways: __building databases__ and __manipulating data__.

That is, we can divide the language into two broad categories: 
* Data Definition Language (DDL) 
* Data Manipulation Language (DML)

## Data Definition Language

Data Definition Language is what we use when we are creating, altering, or removing database objects.
That is, when working with tables, views, or what-have-you, you may be using `CREATE`, `ALTER`, or `DROP` statements
