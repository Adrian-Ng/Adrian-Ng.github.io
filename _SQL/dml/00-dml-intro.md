Structured Query Language (SQL) is an easy-to-learn, albeit, high level language that you'll find being used pretty much wherever you come across relational databases.
It is used in essentially two ways: building databases and retrieving data from these databases.

That is, we can divide the language into two broad categories: 
* Data Definition Language (DDL) 
* Data Manipulation Language (DML)

## Data Manipulation Language

Data Manipulation Language is what we use when are working with the data itself. 
For example, this could mean :
* returning data with `SELECT` 
* populating a table with `INSERT`
* changing data with `UPDATE`
* removing data with `DELETE`
