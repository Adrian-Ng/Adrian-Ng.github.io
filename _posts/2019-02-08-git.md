## git setup

```bash
git config --global user.name ""
git config --global user.email ""

git config --global credential.helper store
```

## git rm

This example removes from the local repository all the auxillary files that `TeX` likes to generate each time I render my cv.

```bash
git rm --cached cv.aux cv.fdb_latexmk cv.fls cv.log cv.out .cv.synctex
```



```bash
git status
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        deleted:    cv.aux
        deleted:    cv.fdb_latexmk
        deleted:    cv.fls
        deleted:    cv.log
        deleted:    cv.out
        deleted:    cv.synctex.gz

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        cv.aux
        cv.fdb_latexmk
        cv.fls
        cv.log
        cv.out
        cv.synctex.gz
```

Now I need to ignore these files. I create a `.gitignore` file in the root of the respository.

```bash
touch .gitignore
```

And it's just a matter of adding filenames to this file. After which, they should not long appear in the list of untracked files:

```bash
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        deleted:    cv.aux
        deleted:    cv.fdb_latexmk
        deleted:    cv.fls
        deleted:    cv.log
        deleted:    cv.out
        deleted:    cv.synctex.gz

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        .gitignore
```
