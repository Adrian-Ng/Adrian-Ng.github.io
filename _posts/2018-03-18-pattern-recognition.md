It just so happens that my surname and Nigeria's top level domain (TLD) have something in common. You might say that this page is the result of bit of pattern recognition and good timing!

The purpose of this page is to have a handy place for my reference notes on Data Science and coding in general. The primary audience is myself, but if someone stumbles upon this place and finds something useful, then great!

Adrian.
